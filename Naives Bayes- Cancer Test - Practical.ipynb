    "Bayes' Formula  (Mammogram probabilities)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' formula is an important method for computing conditional probabilities. It is often used to compute posterior probabilities (as opposed to priorior probabilities) given observations. For example, a patient is observed to have a certain symptom, and Bayes' formula can be used to compute the probability that a diagnosis is correct, given that observation. We illustrate this idea with details practically as seen in the python code below:\n",
